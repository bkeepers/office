# Hello Internet World

Welcome to my GitHub office. Well, my "office". I'm happy to invite you to my real office, but I'm guessing you don't live near me (if you do, you should come visit my real office).

So this repository is my internet office. Feel free to use it in any way you would use an office. Say hi, ask questions, hang out, make beatiful art on the chalkboard.
